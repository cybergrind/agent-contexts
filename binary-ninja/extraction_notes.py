Nuitka Bytecode Extraction Notes

This script documents the approach to extract Python bytecode from a Nuitka-compiled binary.
Based on analysis of zx-sync-sdk.exe.bndb using Binary Ninja.
"""

# The analysis revealed several key functions in the binary related to Python bytecode:
# 1. ai/deserialize_python_objects (at 0x141bb5fe0)
# 2. ai/setup_bytecode_loader (at 0x141bc9380)
# 3. ai/import_or_create_module (at 0x141bc8bc0)
# 4. ai/finalize_python_modules (at 0x141bc9610)

# Extraction approaches:

    """
    Static Analysis Approach
    
    1. Identify data sections containing Python constants and marshalled code objects
    2. Look for patterns that match Python marshalled objects
    3. Extract and unmarshal these objects to recover the bytecode
    
    Key areas to examine:
    - Data references from ai/deserialize_python_objects
    - String constants related to module loading
    - Binary patterns matching Python's marshal format

def approach_2_dynamic_tracing():
    """
    Dynamic Tracing Approach
    
    1. Run the binary in a debugger
    2. Set breakpoints at functions like ai/deserialize_python_objects
    3. Capture the arguments and return values
    4. Extract the Python objects being created
    
    Required tools:
    - GDB or WinDbg (depending on platform)
    - Python debug symbols if available

    pass

def approach_3_custom_loader():
    """
    Custom Loader Approach
    
    1. Create a Python script that mimics Nuitka's module loading mechanism
    2. Replace key functions to intercept the bytecode loading process
    3. Dump the bytecode objects as they're loaded
    
    This approach requires:
    - Understanding how Nuitka registers its loader via sys.meta_path
    - Creating a custom finder/loader that captures bytecode

# Detailed Extraction Process for this binary:

def extract_bytecode():
    """
    Specific steps for extracting bytecode from zx-sync-sdk.exe:
    
    1. Locate the data section referenced by ai/deserialize_python_objects
    2. Identify the binary format used for storing bytecode
    3. Extract and parse these data blocks
    4. Convert the extracted data back to Python bytecode format
    5. Use the dis module to disassemble the bytecode
    """
    pass

# Example pattern to look for in the binary:
# Python marshal has a specific format:
# - Magic number (e.g. 0x0A0D0D0A for Python 3.9)
# - Timestamp (4 bytes)
# - Type code (1 byte, where 'c' = code object)
# - Code object structure:
#   - Argcount, posonlyargcount, kwonlyargcount, nlocals, stacksize, flags (all integers)
#   - Code string (bytecode)
#   - Constants tuple
#   - Names tuple
#   - Varnames tuple
#   - Freevars tuple
#   - Cellvars tuple
#   - Filename string
#   - Name string
#   - First line number
#   - Lnotab (line number table)

# Key memory addresses to investigate (from the disassembly):
# - data_141d2d218 - Likely points to the bytecode loader state
# - data_141d2d210 - Could be related to module cache
# - References from ai/deserialize_python_objects (0x141bb5fe0)

# Next steps:
# 1. Examine ai/deserialize_python_objects implementation in detail
# 2. Look for large data blocks that could contain marshalled bytecode
# 3. Implement a parser based on the observed format
"""
Execution plan:
1. Analyze ai/deserialize_python_objects function in depth
2. Identify data sections through cross-references
3. Extract and attempt to unmarshal data blocks
4. Create a mapping of original Python modules
